# SenSaison

SenSaison is a platform on which users record seasonal scientific observations. Users' data is verified, recorded, and stored for use in research projects. We maintain an open database, allowing any user to download and use collected data as they see fit.

As climate change causes our seasons to shift, seasonal events are affected in kind. On average, winters are shortening, summers are lengthening, and the timings of seasonal events are changing. The purpose of SenSaison is to record the timing of such seasonal events to improve our understanding of how these changes work and how they will affect us in the short- and long-term.

On their account page, users are able to create new observations, search for local observations around themselves or any chosen location, and view the observations they have made in the past. Any user is also able to download a file containing observations filtered however they would like. These files are distributed in .csv format.

SenSaison is in active development. Our team intends to add many additional features over time. Stay tuned!

The app is developed using NodeJS and the database is maintained using MySQL. Styling on the page is primarily powered by Materialize. User credentials are handled by Google OAuth. Data mapping is done with Google Maps and Places APIs.
